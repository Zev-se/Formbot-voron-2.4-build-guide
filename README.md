# formbot-voron-build-guide
Guide and tips and tricks for building a formbot 2.4

### What is this?
- This is instructions of when to switch between the different manuals
- This is headsup where we felt the instructions were unclear
- This is hopefully a way for us to save future builder of avoiding the misstakes we made
- This is tips and tricks to make life easier when building
- This is a collabrative effort

### What isn't it?
- It's not alternative instructions for how to build your Voron
- It's not an official Formbot product

### Background
This project started as a ![blogpost](https://zev.se/posts/building_a_voron_2.4/), partly as a review and partly to give others the help I needed where I could. My blog brefly went down and that's when I noticed people still read it even though I've not linked it for months. THis is when SebKuzminsky said this should probalby be a collaborative effort instead and that my blog problably wasn't the place to have this. Said and done here we are.

### Future
Our hope is this community effort can live on. The kits evolve but we won't buy a new kit every other month. Thus we need your help. Has things changed? Are the instructions out of date? Are the images inaccurate? We welcome you to contribute. Create a pull request or tag us on Discord. We're happy for any and every feedback we can get.
