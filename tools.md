# Tools

* Crimping tool for JST connectors needed for some kits and for tinkering. Voron Design recommends Engineer
PA-09, PA-20, or PA-21.  Others in the community recommend IWISS iCrimp
SN-28B or Iwiss 2820M.
* A nice set of metric hex keys, e.g. Wera 950/9 or Wiha 26390.  You need 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm.
* Phillips screwdriver, P0 size
* straight edge or ruler
* machinist's square or 123 blocks (for squaring the frame)
* clamps (for squaring the frame)
* measuring tape (for checking diagonals when squaring the frame)
* Threadlocker
* Isopropal alcohol
* Grease, super lube is a good alternative, spray white lithium grease is another good option (e.g. <https://www.wd40.com/products/white-lithium-grease/>).


# Optional tools

* A set of drill bits might be needed to fix a few holes a fraction to small

* Plastic bins for sorting parts. Dealing with screws in ziplock-bags got
old very quickly. Anything will do but I would probably buy something
along the one below. If they have loose compartments use some hotglue
to save yourself from dealing with walls getting loose.
