# Tools

* Crimping tool for JST connectors.  Voron Design recommends Engineer
PA-09, PA-20, or PA-21.  Others in the community recommend IWISS iCrimp
SN-28B or Iwiss 2820M.

* A nice set of metric hex keys, e.g. Wera 950/9 or Wiha 26390.


# Optional tools

* A set of drill bits might be needed to fix a few holes a fraction to small: ![](/images/tolarance_too_small.jpeg)

* Plastic bins for sorting parts. Dealing with screws in ziplock-bags got
old very quickly. Anything will do but I would probably buy something
along the one below. If they have loose compartments use some hotglue
to save yourself from dealing with walls getting loose.
